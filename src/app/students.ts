Like so many students who were not proficient with technology, he struggled to keep up with remote classes. His former school didn't have the time or inclination to help him, and he fell further and further behind Fortunately a friend told him about the new Learn4Life high school that opened in San Antonio. In just three months he was able to catch up on credits and graduate. Teachers at my former school weren't involved with the students, he explained. Here, the smaller classes, and letting us work on a subject at our own speed made all the difference for me."

        story:"The transition to high school from junior high was challenging for Serina. The schoolwork became more demanding, and her teachers didn't take time to understand where she needed help Starting high school changed my perspective. Everything got harder and nobody tried to understand where I needed the help. The teachers just wanted to get through the class, said Serina, age 17, who continued to struggle at her pervious school When she first came to Learn4Life, she had no idea what she wanted to do with her life. But, with personalized instruction and one-on-one attention, she soon began to flourish. Plus, with a flexible schedule, she could go at her own pace. Learn4Life is very homey, she explained. Just the way the teachers spoke to us and addressed us every day. They understood where I was coming from and where I needed the extra help.In 2018, Angelina graduated from Learn4Life and continued her education at Pierce College, graduating in 2020 with an Associates Degree. Shortly after, she decided to transfer to CSUN where she is currently working on her bachelors."

        story:"Rudy's early childhood was ordinary and happy; he enjoyed school, played sports, and had lots of friends. He always had a huge appetite for learning and was nicknamed Speedy by his fourth-grade teacher for his desire to finish his schoolwork before his classmates. Early on, Rudy's home environment was solid and enjoyable. He was raised by two working class parents who taught him the importance of discipline, education, and respect. However, his father was an alcoholic and a drug addict who became abusive, both physically and verbally. Rudy found himself living in a constant state of fear. Eventually, his family lost their home and his parents divorced."

        story:"Unfortunately, his childhood trauma was just beginning. Many of Rudy's family members were former or current gang members, so violence and conflict were normal for him and he began to think that this type of behavior was permissible. While attending middle school, Rudy was heavily immersed in gang culture, despite maintaining a 4.0 GPA. He felt angry at the world and was often in trouble for lashing out verbally or through violence because conflict felt normal to him. He grew increasingly rebellious and completely lost track of his positive attributes and strengths. He was also apathetic towards school and lost his motivation to learn because he felt his teachers didn't care about his well-being and overall success"
